## Intoduction ##

Currently Apple has provided their own MPEG4 descriptor tags. They are not officially documented, but another open source project, called AtomicParsley, has [documented](http://atomicparsley.sourceforge.net/mpeg-4files.html) what has been 'reverse engineered'.

There is indication that ID3v2 will be added ([see here](http://www.mp4ra.org/specs.html#id3v2)), but it is not clear at this point what applications have actually implemented this.
